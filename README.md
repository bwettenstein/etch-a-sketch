# Etch-a-sketch

This project is from the cirriculum of [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav) and is designed to get me familiar with DOM manipulation as it involves creating divs and handling events through javascript.
