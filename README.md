# Etch-a-sketch

The project can be viewed [here](https://bwettenstein.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

This project is from the cirriculum of [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav) and is designed to get me familiar with DOM manipulation as it involves creating divs and handling events through javascript. 

# Struggles
The biggest struggle from this project was figuring out how to create a grid of divs and how to get them to change color when the cursor hovers over them through javascript coding. 

# Main learning outcomes
Learning how to use flexbox by using it to create the grid of divs.
Learning how to use query selectors to select specific elements, and event listeners to trigger actions on hover and click. 
Had a brief introduction to the "this" pointer by using it to change the color of the grid elements when they're hovered. 

# Future improvement ideas
Adding the ability to change the color that occurs when the cursor hovers over the grids
